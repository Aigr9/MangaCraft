# Introduction

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/kui.png)

Hi, my master! I’m Kawei·Twelve, an AI assistant to help you to colorize any kinds of manga. Following my instruction, you can transform any manga you like into a full-colored one.

Even without any painting experience, without any color knowledges, without any professional software skills, you can master the color of arbitrary black-and-white manga (or called comic) by follow this tutorial step by step. All you need to do is to select a few colors and mark where will be colorized, I’ll do all the rest.

# Let's begin.

In the following sections, I’ll teach you how to colorize your favorited manga by colorize this sample. 

Here is our final goal in this example:

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p1.jpg)

You will be able to colorize the left image into the right image with my assistance.

# Step 1: Download the sample.

First, please download sample manga from the link below.

[Click here to download sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/p2.jpg)

# Step 2: Familiar with the UI.

Since the UI is the only way we can communicate with each other, please read the instruction carefully.

When the website is loaded, the interface should be like this:

![p3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p3.png)

The colorful row in the middle bottom is a *simple* palette, Master. Naïve in first glance, but it can suite most situation. So, I recommend you to use this palette first before we step further. A more sophisticated palette is placed on the right side, if you are a professional painter, you can customize your color there.

![p4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p4.png)

The four buttons in the bottom right corner is used to edit your manga.

![p5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p5.png)

In clock-wise manner, these buttons are “Pencil”, “Eraser”, “Smart Colorization” and “Upload Manga”, respectively. A status bar is placed under these buttons, which indicate the painting progress/status of MangaCraft.

NOTICE: You have to wait until the status is “finished”, before click “Smart Colorization" or “Upload Manga” button.

On the right upper corner, there are two buttons: “Upload user editing” and “Download user editing”.

![p6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p6.png)

You can save or load your colorization hints (all points and scribble lines you have created.) by click these buttons. By saving user editing to local storage, you can pause or continue work anytime and anywhere as your wish.

# Step 3: Upload a black-and-white manga to the website.

Please upload your sample by this procedure.

# Step 4: Familiar with Shortcuts.

Here is a briefing about shortcuts:

    Mouse Left：Drawing.
    Mouse Right/Middle：Moving.
    Mouse Wheel：Zoom-in or Zoom-out.
    Ctrl + Z: Undo.
    Ctrl + Y: Redo.
    Ctrl + Mouse Wheel: Shifting color.
    
You can use this interface to draw something, for example:

# Step 5: Colorization.

In this section, I’ll demonstrate how to colorize your manga step by step.

## 1. Clearing the edge.

In this step, the color you shall use is here:

![p16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p16.png)

Select the White color (On the leftmost grid of *simple* palette), then scribble it on the edge space of manga, conversation block, and anywhere that should NOT paint with any color other than white.

This procedure is to ensure that the edge space and conversation block won’t be contaminated by the colors you will apply on following steps. 

Example：

![p9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p9.png)

## 2. Drawing the skin.

In this step, we will colorize her skin. The color should be:

![p17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p17.png)

Example：

![p10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p10.png)

## 3. Drawing the eyes.

Let us lit up the eyes. In this example, we choose green：

Example：

![p11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p11.png)

## 4. Drawing the clothes.

Colorize character’s clothes.

![p18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p18.png)

Example：

![p12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p12.png)

## 5. Drawing the background.

Colorize the background. A background may contain several colors (e.g. Yellow-Blue-Green-Red), the more color you used, the more colorful result is.

![p18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p18.png)

Example：

![p13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p13.png)

# 6. Optimizing and finishing.

When you complete your painting, the interface may similar to this:

![p14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p14.png)

Click “Smart Colorization”

![p15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p15.png)

And then you can see the full-colored manga. You can save this picture, or get back to the main interface to adjust the color, until you are satisfied with your result.

# Additional Example.

The tutorial is end. If you want to learn further about MangaCraft, here are some examples for you. You can use “Upload Manga” button (See (1) in below picture) to upload black-and-white sample, then use “Upload user editing” (See (1) in below picture) to upload the user scribbles.

![p19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p19.png)

You can learn in these examples. All of these examples are colorized by the author of MangaCraft, and they look similar in color style. It could be changed if you painting these manga in your own style.
