# Who am I?

Greeting, Master! Welcome to MangaCraft, the best manga colorization AI assistant in the world. I’m Kawei·Twelve, the kanban musume (aka. brand ambassador) of this software. Following my instruction, you can transform any manga you like into a full-colored one.

Don’t be worried, Master. Even without any painting experience, you can master this software by follow this tutorial step by step. All you need to do is to select a few colors and mark where will be colorized, I’ll do the rest.

*（There will be a portrait of Kawei·Twelve, our diligent illustrator is working on it.）*

# A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a simple sample.

In the following sections, I’ll teach you how to colorize your favorited manga by make this sample full-colored. Here is our final goal (from left, to right):

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p1.jpg)

# Step 1: Download the sample

First, please download sample manga from the link below.

[Click here to download sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/p2.jpg)

# Step 2: Familiar with panel

Since panel is the only way we can communicate with each other, please read the instruction carefully.

When the website is loaded, the interface should be like this:

![p3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p3.png)

The colorful row in the middle bottom is a *simple* palette, Master. Naïve in first glance, but it can suite most situation. So, I recommend you to use this palette first before we step further. A more sophisticated palette is placed on the right side, if you are a professional painter, you can customize your color at there.

![p4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p4.png)

The four buttons in the bottom right corner is used to edit your manga.

![p5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p5.png)

In clock-wise manner, these buttons are “Pencil”, “Eraser”, “Smart Colorization” and “Upload Manga”, respectively. A status bar is placed under these buttons, which indicate the painting progress/status of MangaCraft.

WARNING: Master, you must wait until the status is “finished”, before click “Smart Colorization" or “Upload Manga” button!


On the right upper corner, there are two buttons: “Upload Pattern” and “Download Pattern”

![p6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p6.png)

You can save or load your colorization pattern by click these buttons. By saving pattern to local storage, you can pause or continue work anytime and anywhere as your wish.

(Note: the “colorization pattern” is a .png file, it contains the line or dot you “drew” on the manga. For how to draw a pattern, see Step 5.)

# Step 3: Upload a black-and-white manga to the website

Master, please upload your sample by this procedure.

![p7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p7.png)

# Step 4: Familiar with Shortcuts

Here is a briefing about shortcuts:

    Mouse Left：Draw or erase colored line.
    Mouse Right/Middle：Moving canvas
    Mouse Wheel：Zoom-in or Zoom-out canvas
    Ctrl + Z: Cancel your last change
    Ctrl + Y: Redo the last change you canceled.
    Ctrl + Mouse Wheel: Select color
    
You can use this interface to draw something, for example:

# Step 5: Colorization

In this section, I’ll demonstrate how to colorize your favorited manga step by step.

## 1. Clear the edge

WARNING: Read carefully, complete this step BEFORE do anything. 

WARNING: Skipping this step would make manga too *dirty* to read.

In this step, the color you shall use is here:

![p16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p16.png)

Select the White color (On the leftmost grid of *simple* palette), then scribble it on the edge space of manga, conversation block, and anywhere that should NOT paint with any color other than white.

This procedure is to ensure the edge space and conversation block won’t be contaminated by the colors you will apply on following steps. 

Example：

![p9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p9.png)

## 2. Make her skin alive.

In this step, we will colorize her skin. The color should be:

![p17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p17.png)


Example：

![p10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p10.png)

## 3. “Delight” her eye.

Let us lit up her eye. In this example, we choose green：
(However, Master, I recommend you to try other colors.)

![p18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p18.png)

Example：

![p11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p11.png)

## 4. Don’t forget to “dress” her clothes.

Colorize character’s uniform. Again. I encourage you to try another option, Master.

![p18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p18.png)

Example：

![p12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p12.png)

## 5. Dye the background

Colorize the background. A background may contain several colors (e.g. Yellow-Blue-Green-Red), the more color you used, the more colorful result is.
(Please set your mind free, Master! Painting is an art to demonstrate your thought, isn’t it?)

![p18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p18.png)

Example：

![p13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p13.png)

# 6. Adjust, Optimize, and Well-done!

When you complete your painting, the interface may similar to this:

![p14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p14.png)

Click “Smart Colorization”

![p15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p15.png)

And TADA! Full-colored manga! You can save this picture, or get back to the main interface to adjust the color, until you are satisfied with your result.

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p1.jpg)

# Additional Example

The tutorial is end, Master. If you want to learn further about MangaCraft, here are some examples for you. You can use “Upload Manga” button (See picture (1) ) to upload black-and-white sample, then use “Upload Pattern” (See picture (2) ) to upload colorization pattern.

For more information about “colorization pattern”, see Step 2: Familiar with panel.

![p19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/imgs/p19.png)


You can learn how to draw colorization pattern in these examples. However, since all of these examples are colorized by myself, they look similar in color style. It would be more meaningful if you painting these manga by your own style.

Enjoy your journey!
